# eta_car1nae p5.js [Portfolio](https://urit-gupta.github.io/portfolio)

Brought to you with love, programming, and p5.js

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a collection of sketches (coding art) displayed in the form of a website. To open the website, click on the [**Portfolio**](https://urit-gupta.github.io/portfolio) button above or on this link: https://urit-gupta.github.io/portfolio

_P.S. This is my first website!_

## Navigation

On first load, the website will display a random sketch from a list. The following navigation is currently implemented:

- Use Right or Up arrow keys to go to the next sketch
- Use Left or Down arrow keys to go to the previous sketch
- Reloading the page will permute the current sketch*
  
*Only works if the sketch does not set a random state i.e. does not reproduce identical results over multiple runs.

Here's what each site button does:
1. **Code for this Sketch**: Opens the code for the currently displayed sketch in the p5.js editor
2. **Instagram**: Opens my Instagram art page
3. **GitHub**: Opens my GitHub profile page

## Planned TODOs

The following functionality will be implemented in the future:

1. Accessibility implementations (Aria labels, keyboard-only navigation, theme switching, screen-reader friendly elements, etc.)
2. Gallery page to view multiple sketches and details
3. Go to gallery button
4. Remembering which sketch the user is on
5. Permute sketch button with information about the random state
6. Clicking on title displays a random sketch (essentially a hard reload)
7. Clicking on copyright box points to github repo

### That's all, folks!
